/*
  RA: layout of the game-memory snapshot that ee_core writes into IOP
  memory every frame and the raudp IOP module reads from there.

  Why DMA into a buffer instead of a SIF command: a SIF command number is
  an index into the handler table, and in-game that table belongs to the
  game (OPL's own side allocates exactly one slot, see SifSetCmdBuffer in src/system.c). An
  index past the end writes into someone else's memory, and
  sceSifAddCmdHandler returns void, so the error stays silent. The shared
  tables are left alone: ee_core allocates a buffer in the IOP heap with
  SifAllocIopHeap, passes the address to the module as a load argument,
  and writes to it directly from then on.

  Torn writes: DMA is not atomic and copies from the start of the buffer
  to the end, so seq is repeated in a trailer word placed AFTER the
  values (RA_SNAP_TRAILER_OFF). The reader takes seq from the header,
  copies the values, then compares the trailer and the header again; any
  difference means the snapshot was overwritten mid-copy and is skipped.
  The seq_end field inside the header cannot detect this: it is written
  before the values arrive.
